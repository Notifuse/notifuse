# v25.0 Release Notes

## Bug Fix: Contact.Created Automation Trigger Not Working

Fixed a bug where automations with `contact.created` trigger would fail to enroll contacts when a `list_id` was configured on the automation.

GitHub Issue: #191

### Root Cause

The `automation_enroll_contact` function incorrectly checked if the contact was subscribed to `automation.list_id` before enrolling. However, `list_id` is only meant for generating unsubscribe URLs in email templates, not for filtering enrollment.

A newly created contact can never be subscribed to a list yet, so `contact.created` triggers with `list_id` set would silently fail.

### Fix

- Removed the `p_list_id` parameter from `automation_enroll_contact` function (now 4 params instead of 5)
- Migration v25 regenerates all active automation trigger functions to use the new signature

### Upgrade

No manual action required. The migration runs automatically on startup and regenerates triggers for all live automations.
