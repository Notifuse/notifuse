### üîí SECURITY UPGRADE: PASETO ‚Üí JWT + Enhanced Authentication Security

This is a **major security release** that migrates the authentication system from PASETO to JWT (HS256) and implements comprehensive security improvements.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES

**Migration Requirements:**

- **REQUIRED**: Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable before upgrading
  - **CRITICAL FOR EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS**:
    - If you already have `SECRET_KEY` set: **Keep it unchanged** (do not generate a new one)
    - If migrating from PASETO: Use your existing PASETO key: `export SECRET_KEY="$PASETO_PRIVATE_KEY"`
  - **For new installations only**: Generate new key: `export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)`
- Server will automatically restart after migration to reload JWT configuration

**üö® CRITICAL WARNING**:

- **DO NOT change your existing SECRET_KEY** - it encrypts all workspace integration secrets (email provider API keys, SMTP passwords, etc.)
- Changing SECRET_KEY will:
  - ‚ùå Make all encrypted integration secrets unreadable (permanent data loss)
  - ‚ùå Break all email sending (SparkPost, Mailjet, Mailgun, SMTP credentials lost)
  - ‚ùå Invalidate all JWT tokens and user sessions
- **Only generate a new SECRET_KEY for fresh installations with no existing data**

**What Gets Invalidated (During PASETO ‚Üí JWT Migration):**

- ‚úó All user sessions (users must log in again - PASETO tokens ‚Üí JWT tokens)
- ‚úó All API keys (must be regenerated - PASETO format ‚Üí JWT format)
- ‚úó All pending workspace invitations (invitation tokens were PASETO-signed)
- ‚úó All active magic codes (migrating from plain-text ‚Üí HMAC-SHA256 hashes)

**Why:** PASETO tokens are incompatible with JWT verification. Clean migration ensures no security gaps.

**Important Notes:**

- If you're already using JWT (not migrating from PASETO), and you keep your existing `SECRET_KEY`, your existing sessions remain valid.
- The `SECRET_KEY` is also used to encrypt workspace integration secrets (API keys, SMTP credentials). **Never change it on existing deployments** or you'll lose access to all encrypted credentials permanently.

### Security Improvements

#### 1. **JWT Authentication (HS256)**

- Migrated from PASETO to industry-standard JWT with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Simplified setup**: Uses symmetric key (`SECRET_KEY`) instead of PASETO's asymmetric key pair
  - No need to generate and manage separate public/private keys
  - Single `SECRET_KEY` environment variable for all cryptographic operations
  - Easier deployment and configuration management
- Algorithm confusion attack prevention (strict HMAC validation)
- Comprehensive token validation (signature, expiration, claims)
- Compatible with standard JWT libraries and tools

#### 2. **HMAC-Protected Magic Codes**

- Magic codes now stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes (no plain text in database)
- Database compromise cannot reveal authentication codes
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks
- Migration clears all existing plain-text codes

#### 3. **Server-Side Logout**

- New `/api/user.logout` endpoint (POST, requires authentication)
- Deletes ALL sessions for the authenticated user from database
- Tokens become immediately invalid after logout
- Protected endpoints now verify session exists in database
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if session has been deleted
- Frontend integration with graceful error handling

#### 4. **Rate Limiting for Authentication Endpoints**

- Protection against brute force attacks and email bombing
- In-memory rate limiter with sliding window algorithm
- Sign-in endpoint: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per email address
- Verify code endpoint: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per email address
- Rate limiter automatically resets on successful authentication
- Thread-safe concurrent access with automatic cleanup
- Independent rate limits per user and per endpoint
- Prevents magic code brute force attacks (blocks 99%+ of attempts)

### Features

- Enhanced session verification in `GetCurrentUser` endpoint
- Added `DeleteAllSessionsByUserID` method to user repository
- Added `Logout` method to user service interface
- Frontend `AuthContext` now calls backend logout before clearing local storage
- Migration automatically cleans up incompatible authentication artifacts

### Testing

- New integration tests for logout functionality (`tests/integration/user_logout_test.go`)
- New integration tests for rate limiter (`tests/integration/rate_limiter_test.go`)
- Unit tests for rate limiter with race detection
- Fixed race condition in concurrent rate limiter test (atomic operations)
- All tests pass with `-race` flag enabled

### Documentation

- Updated security audit document (`SECURITY_AUDIT_JWT_SESSIONS.md`)
- Changed "No Server-Side Logout" from üî¥ CRITICAL to ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Changed "Brute Force Risk" from MEDIUM to LOW
- Added detailed implementation notes and testing coverage
- Comprehensive migration guide in v15 migration file

### Post-Migration Actions Required

1. **Users**: Log in again with email/password (or magic code)
2. **API Key Holders**: Regenerate API keys in Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. **Integrations**: Update all API integrations with new keys
4. **Workspace Admins**: Resend pending invitations via Settings ‚Üí Members ‚Üí Invitations

### Migration Notes

- Migration v15 is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Estimated migration time: < 1 second
- Server automatically restarts after migration
- Migration validates `SECRET_KEY` environment variable before proceeding
- Comprehensive migration summary displayed in console

## [14.1] - 2025-11-01

### Features

- **Bulk Contact Import**: New `/api/contacts.import` endpoint for efficiently importing large numbers of contacts
  - Creates or updates multiple contacts in a single batch operation using PostgreSQL bulk upsert
  - Returns individual operation results (created/updated/error) for each contact
  - Optional bulk subscription to lists via `subscribe_to_lists` parameter
  - Significantly faster than individual upsert operations for large imports
  - Batch size of 100 contacts processed at a time in the UI
  - Supports partial success - some contacts can succeed while others fail validation

## [14.0] - 2025-10-31

### Database Schema Changes

- Added `channel_options` JSONB column to `message_history` table to store email/SMS/push delivery options (CC, BCC, FromName, ReplyTo...)

### Features

- **Internal Task Scheduler**: Tasks now execute automatically every 30 seconds
  - No external cron job required
  - Configurable via `TASK_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `TASK_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL`, `TASK_SCHEDULER_MAX_TASKS`
  - Starts automatically with the app, stops gracefully on shutdown
  - Faster task processing (30s vs 60s minimum with external cron)
- **Privacy Settings**: New optional configuration for telemetry and update checks
  - `TELEMETRY` environment variable (optional) - Send anonymous usage statistics
  - `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable (optional) - Check for new versions
  - Both can be configured via setup wizard if not set as environment variables
  - For existing installations: migration v14 sets both to `true` by default (respects env vars if set)
  - Environment variables always take precedence over database settings
- Message history now stores email delivery options:
  - CC (carbon copy recipients)
  - BCC (blind carbon copy recipients)
  - FromName (sender display name override)
  - ReplyTo (reply-to address override)
- Message preview drawer displays email delivery options when present
- Only stores email options in this version (SMS/push to be added later)
- Modernized Docker Compose to use current standards: renamed `docker-compose.yml` to `compose.yaml`, removed deprecated `version` field, updated commands to use `docker compose` plugin syntax, and improved `.env` file integration

### UI Changes

- Removed cron setup instructions from setup wizard
- Removed cron status warning banner from workspace layout
- Simpler onboarding experience - no manual cron configuration needed
- Added preview mode to notification center
- **Setup Wizard Improvements**:
  - Added newsletter subscription option
  - PASETO keys configuration moved to collapsible "Advanced Settings" section
  - Added "Privacy Settings" section for telemetry and update check configuration
  - Improved restart handling: displays setup completion screen immediately while server restarts
  - User can review generated keys before manually redirecting to signin

### Deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)

- `/api/cron` HTTP endpoint (internal scheduler is now primary)
- `/api/cron.status` HTTP endpoint (still functional but not advertised)

### Fixes

- Fix: SMTP now supports unauthenticated/anonymous connections (e.g., local mail relays on port 25)
- Fix: Docker images now built with CGO disabled to prevent SIGILL crashes on older CPUs
- Fix: Decode HTML entities in URL attributes to ensure links with query parameters work correctly in MJML-compiled emails
- Fix: Normalize browser timezone names to canonical IANA format to prevent timezone mismatch errors
- Fix: Broadcast pause also pauses the associated task

### Migration Notes

- Added `ShouldRestartServer()` method to migration interface
- Migrations can now trigger automatic server restart when config reload is needed
- Existing messages will have `channel_options = NULL` (no backfill)
- Migration v14 adds default telemetry and update check settings for existing installations (both default to `true`)
- Migration is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Estimated migration time: < 1 second per workspace
- Server will automatically restart after migration to reload all configuration settings
