## What is a Workspace?

A workspace in Notifuse is a self-contained environment that includes:

- **Contacts and Lists**: Your subscriber database and segmentation
- **Email Templates**: Custom designs and layouts
- **Campaigns**: Broadcast and automated email sequences
- **Transactional Notifications**: Event-triggered emails
- **Message & webhooks History**: All messages sent to the contact and webhooks received
- **Settings**: Email providers and configurations

## Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Complete Isolation**: Each workspace operates independently
- **Separate Databases**: Contacts, campaigns, and data are isolated
- **Individual Settings**: Each workspace has its own email providers and configurations
