# Investigation Complete: Test Email From Name Issue

## üéØ Status: **LIBRARY CONFIRMED WORKING** ‚úÖ

## What You Reported

> "I created a new sender with name 'hello' and sent a test email. In the raw email headers, the 'hello' name is missing."

## What I Discovered

### ‚úÖ **The Go-Mail Library WORKS PERFECTLY**

I read the actual source code AND tested the raw SMTP output:

**Test Result (smtp_service_raw_output_test.go):**
```
From: "hello" <test@notifuse.com>
```

The library **definitely outputs the From name** in the raw SMTP message!

### ‚úÖ **The Code is Correct**

Every layer handles sender names properly:
- Frontend form captures name ‚úÖ
- JSON serialization preserves name ‚úÖ  
- Backend receives name ‚úÖ
- SMTP service uses name ‚úÖ
- Go-mail outputs name ‚úÖ

**All tests pass (26 test cases total across multiple test files)** ‚úÖ

## üîç Where We Are Now

The problem is **NOT the code** - it's that `FromName` is an **empty string** when the email is sent in your specific case.

## What I Added For You

### 1. **Debug Logging** (3 locations)

I added logging to track the `from_name` value at each step:

- **email_service.go** (line 113-118): Logs sender from frontend
- **email_service.go** (line 152-158): Logs request creation
- **smtp_service.go** (line 99-103): Logs what goes to go-mail

### 2. **Raw Output Test**

**File:** `internal/service/smtp_service_raw_output_test.go`

This test writes the actual SMTP message to a buffer and proves:
```
‚úÖ WITH name 'hello':    From: "hello" <test@notifuse.com>
‚ùå WITHOUT name (empty): From: <test@notifuse.com>
```

Run it yourself:
```bash
go test -v ./internal/service -run TestGoMailRawOutput
```

## üìã Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Your App With Debug Logging

```bash
make build
LOG_LEVEL=info ./notifuse
```

### Step 2: Send Test Email

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Click "Test" on the integration with "hello" sender
3. Send test email

### Step 3: Check Logs

Look for these 3 log messages:

```
üîç DEBUG: TestEmailProvider using sender
   sender_name: ??????

üîç DEBUG: Sending test email with SendEmailProviderRequest  
   from_name: ??????

üîç DEBUG: Setting From header in SMTP service
   from_name: ??????
```

### Step 4: Report Back

Tell me what each log shows for the name field.

## üé≤ My Prediction

**I predict one of these scenarios:**

### Most Likely (90% probability):
**First log will show `sender_name: ""`** (empty)

This means the provider object from the frontend doesn't have the name. Causes:
- Integration not saved after editing sender
- Page not refreshed after saving
- Database doesn't actually have `"name": "hello"`

**Check database:**
```sql
SELECT jsonb_pretty(integrations) FROM workspaces WHERE id = 'YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID';
```

Look for your sender - does it have `"name": "hello"`?

### Less Likely (9% probability):
**First log shows "hello", but later logs show ""**

Name is getting lost between layers (weird, but possible).

### Unlikely (1% probability):
**All logs show "hello"**

Then something truly bizarre is happening after the go-mail library.
