# Loops.co Loop Builder - Competitive Analysis

## Overview
Loops.co is an email marketing platform with a visual "Loop Builder" for creating automated email sequences. This analysis compares their approach with our Notifuse automation system.

---

## Key Features from Loops.co

### 1. **Loop Triggers** (4 Types)

#### Contact Added
- Triggers when contact is added via integration, form, or API
- **Does NOT trigger** for manually added contacts or CSV uploads (unless "Trigger loops" is checked)
- No additional setup required

#### Contact Updated
- Triggers when contact properties change
- Can specify which field updated
- Can specify "from value" → "to value" transitions
- Example: subscription plan changed from "free" to "paid"

#### Contact Added to List
- Triggers when contact joins a mailing list
- Re-triggers if contact is removed and re-added
- Tied directly to list subscription (contact removed from list = removed from loop)

#### Event Received
- Triggers on custom events (payment received, order placed, etc.)
- Events sent via API, integrations, or forms

### 2. **Node Types** (5 Types)

1. **Email Node** - Send an email
2. **Delay/Timer Node** - Wait before next action
3. **Audience Filter Node** - Filter contacts based on properties
4. **Branching Node** - Split into multiple paths
5. **Experiment Node** - A/B testing

### 3. **Audience Filters**

Two modes:
- **All following nodes**: Filter applies to entire downstream path (contacts removed if stop matching)
- **Next node only**: Filter only checks at next node, then contacts remain regardless

Contacts can follow **multiple branches** if they match multiple audience filters.

### 4. **Branching Loops**

- Add multiple branches from a single point
- Each branch has its own audience filter
- Contacts go down **every branch they match** (not mutually exclusive)
- **Cannot converge branches** back together
- Each branch can contain: emails, timers, filters, more branches, experiments

### 5. **Experiments (A/B Testing)**

- Split contacts into **variants** and **control** groups
- Set sample size percentage (e.g., 60% in experiment, 40% in control)
- Variants split equally within sample (60% with 3 variants = 20% each)
- Optional control branch
- Contacts not in sample size **exit the loop** (if no control)
- Can edit after pausing the loop

### 6. **Pausing vs Stopping**

#### Pausing:
- Can resume anytime
- Scheduled emails will send when resumed (if contacts still match criteria)
- New contacts can enter loop for **24 hours only**
- After 24 hours, new contacts won't enter (prevents outdated emails)
- Email notification sent after 24 hours

#### Stopping:
- No new contacts queue to enter
- Queued contacts are cleared
- More permanent than pausing

### 7. **Mailing List Integration**

- Loops can be restricted to specific mailing lists
- Dropdown in top right of builder
- If contact removed from list, they're removed from loop at next node

## Comparison with Notifuse Automation Plan

### ✅ What We Have That Loops.co Doesn't

1. **Conditional Logic Node**
   - Loops.co only has audience filters (which are simpler)
   - We have full condition evaluation with AND/OR logic

2. **Wait for Event Node**
   - Loops.co doesn't support waiting for specific events mid-flow
   - We can pause execution until event occurs with timeout

3. **Exit Node**
   - Explicit flow termination
   - Loops.co relies on filters to exclude contacts

4. **Webhook Node**
   - Call external APIs and store responses
   - Loops.co has no external integrations mid-flow

5. **Update Contact Property Node**
   - Modify contact data during automation
   - Loops.co doesn't support this

6. **Update List Status Node**
   - Subscribe/unsubscribe during automation
   - Loops.co doesn't support this

7. **Variable/Context System**
   - Pass data between nodes
   - Store webhook responses, node results
   - Loops.co has no inter-node data flow

8. **Version Control**
   - Built-in version tracking with rollback
   - Loops.co requires manual versioning

9. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete change history with user tracking
   - Loops.co doesn't mention audit logging

10. **Test Mode**
    - Safe testing without affecting production
    - Loops.co requires pausing/stopping

11. **Analytics Dashboard**
    - Node-level performance metrics
    - Funnel visualization

    - Send at specific hour in contact's timezone
    - Loops.co has basic delays only

13. **Entry Rules**
    - Prevent duplicate executions
    - Cooldown periods
    - Loops.co doesn't prevent re-entry explicitly

14. **Segment + List Audience Filtering**
    - Combine segment and list filters on trigger
    - Loops.co only has list filtering on trigger

### ✅ What Loops.co Has That We Should Consider

1. **24-Hour Pause Window**
   - Smart feature: prevents outdated emails after long pauses
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Add similar logic to our paused automations
   - Emit warning when automation paused > 24 hours

2. **Multiple Branch Following**
   - Contacts can go down every matching branch (not mutually exclusive)
   - **CURRENT PLAN**: Our condition/split nodes force single path
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Consider adding "parallel branching" feature
   - Use case: Send both "Welcome" and "VIP Offer" if contact matches both

3. **Audience Filter Modes**
   - "All following nodes" vs "Next node only"
   - **CURRENT PLAN**: Our condition nodes are single-point checks
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Add "continuous monitoring" option to condition nodes
   - Contacts automatically exit if they stop matching

4. **Experiment Sample Size Control**
   - Simple slider for sample percentage
   - Automatic equal distribution among variants
   - **CURRENT PLAN**: We have basic split test with 50/50
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Add sample size control to split_test node
   - Add variant weights (e.g., 60% A, 40% B)

5. **Simplified Trigger Setup**
   - Very simple trigger configuration
   - No complex condition builders
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Keep our trigger config simple in UI
   - Hide advanced filters behind "Advanced" accordion

6. **Templates**
   - Pre-built loop templates
   - **EXCLUDED FROM PLAN**: Per user request
   - **RECONSIDER**: Maybe community-contributed templates later

### 🔄 What's Similar

1. **Visual Drag-Drop Builder**
   - Both use visual flow builders
   - Ours uses ReactFlow (more flexible)

2. **Email Node**
   - Both send transactional emails
   - Similar configuration

3. **Delay Node**
   - Both support time-based delays
   - Ours adds timezone awareness

4. **Trigger Types**
   - Contact created/updated
   - List subscribed
   - Custom events
   - Both very similar

5. **A/B Testing**
   - Both support split testing
   - Ours is simpler, theirs has sample size control

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY ADDITIONS

#### 1. Add 24-Hour Pause Warning
```go
// In domain/automation.go
type Automation struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    PausedAt *time.Time `json:"paused_at,omitempty"`
}

// In service
func (s *AutomationService) Pause(ctx context.Context, workspaceID, id string, userID string) error {
    // Set PausedAt timestamp
    // Schedule warning email for 24 hours
}
```

**Benefit**: Prevents users from accidentally sending outdated emails after long pauses.

#### 2. Add "Parallel Branching" Support

**Current**: Condition nodes force single path (if/else)
**Enhancement**: Add "parallel_condition" node type

```go
type ParallelConditionNodeData struct {
    Conditions []ConditionRule `json:"conditions"`
    // Contact follows ALL matching paths, not just first match
}
```

**Use Case**:
```
Trigger: Contact Created
→ Parallel Branch:
  - Path A: If VIP → Send VIP Welcome
  - Path B: If Newsletter Subscriber → Send Newsletter Welcome
  → Contact can receive both if they match both
```

**Benefit**: More flexible workflows, less duplication.

#### 3. Enhance Split Test with Sample Size

**Current**: Basic 50/50 split
**Enhancement**: Add sample size and variant weights

```go
type SplitTestNodeData struct {
    SampleSize      int                `json:"sample_size"`      // Percentage (e.g., 60)
    Variants        []SplitTestVariant `json:"variants"`
    ControlWeight   int                `json:"control_weight"`   // Percentage
}

type SplitTestVariant struct {
    ID     string `json:"id"`
    Label  string `json:"label"`
    Weight int    `json:"weight"` // Percentage within sample
}
```

**Benefit**: More sophisticated A/B testing, matches industry standard.

#### 4. Add Continuous Audience Monitoring

**Current**: Condition nodes are one-time checks
**Enhancement**: Add "monitor" flag to condition nodes

```go
type ConditionNodeData struct {
    Conditions       []ConditionRule `json:"conditions"`
    Logic            string          `json:"logic"` // "AND" or "OR"
    ContinuousCheck  bool            `json:"continuous_check"` // NEW
    // If true, contact exits automation if stops matching
}
```

**Benefit**: Automatically remove contacts when they no longer match criteria.

## 🚫 What NOT to Copy

### 1. No Branch Convergence
Loops.co doesn't allow branches to merge back together. This is a **limitation** we should NOT copy.

**Our Approach**: Allow full flow flexibility with ReactFlow.

### 2. Contacts Exit on No Sample
In Loops.co, if you run 60% experiment with no control, 40% exit and receive nothing.

**Our Approach**: Require control path or show warning.

### 3. Limited Node Types
Only 5 node types. We have 10+.

**Our Approach**: More comprehensive node library.

### 4. No Mid-Flow Actions
Can't update contact properties, call webhooks, or modify lists.

**Our Approach**: Full CRUD capabilities within automation.
