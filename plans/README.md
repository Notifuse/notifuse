# Notifuse Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans for features and architectural changes.

## Current Plans

### ✅ Completed Implementations

1. **[database-connection-manager-complete.md](./database-connection-manager-complete.md)** - **CONSOLIDATED COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**
   - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED & PRODUCTION READY (October 2025)
   - **Purpose:** Comprehensive document covering entire connection manager implementation
   - **What it includes:**
     - Executive summary and problem analysis
     - Complete solution architecture
     - All implementation details (8 phases)
     - Configuration and usage guides
     - Testing strategy and results (all tests passing)
     - Deployment guide and monitoring
     - Troubleshooting and advanced topics
   - **Result:** From 4 workspaces max → UNLIMITED workspaces with 100 connection limit
   
### 📋 Implementation Plans (Reference)

2. **[connection-manager-implementation.md](./connection-manager-implementation.md)**
   - **Status:** Implemented (see consolidated doc above)
   - **Purpose:** Original detailed implementation plan
   - **Key approach:** Small pools (2-3 connections) per workspace database with LRU eviction
   
### 📚 Supporting Documentation

3. **[connection-pooling-vs-per-query.md](./connection-pooling-vs-per-query.md)**
   - **Purpose:** Technical analysis comparing connection pooling vs per-query connections
   - **Key finding:** Connection pooling is 10-100x faster than creating connections per query
   - **Includes:** Benchmarks, load test results, cost analysis

### 🗄️ Archived Plans

4. **[connection-manager-singleton-OLD.md](./connection-manager-singleton-OLD.md)**
   - **Status:** Superseded by shared pool implementation
   - **Why archived:** Original approach didn't scale (reserved too many connections per workspace)
   - **Keep for:** Historical reference and to understand evolution of solution

## Plan Status Legend

- ✅ **Active** - Ready for or currently being implemented
- 📚 **Documentation** - Supporting technical analysis
- 🗄️ **Archived** - Superseded or historical reference

## How to Use Plans

### For Connection Manager Implementation

**Start here:** [database-connection-manager-complete.md](./database-connection-manager-complete.md)

This consolidated document contains everything you need:
- ✅ Complete implementation details
- ✅ Configuration and usage guides  
- ✅ Testing results (all passing)
- ✅ Deployment guide
- ✅ Troubleshooting

### General Guidelines

1. **For completed features:** Read the consolidated completion document
2. **For active implementations:** Use the detailed plan documents
3. **For understanding decisions:** Read the supporting analysis documents
4. **For history:** Review archived plans to see what changed and why

## Plan Creation Guidelines

When creating new plans:
1. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames (e.g., `feature-name-plan.md`)
2. Include clear status at the top (active, draft, archived)
3. Update this README when adding new plans
4. Archive old plans instead of deleting them
