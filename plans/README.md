# Notifuse Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans for features and architectural changes.

## Implemented Features

### Database Connection Manager

**[database-connection-manager-complete.md](./database-connection-manager-complete.md)** - ⚠️ COMPLETED WITH CRITICAL ISSUES

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Fully implemented (October 2025)  
**Production Status:** ⚠️ **NOT READY** - Critical fixes required  
**Code Review:** [CODE_REVIEW.md](../CODE_REVIEW.md) - 15 issues found (3 critical)

**Summary:** Solves "too many connections" errors by implementing a smart connection pool manager that supports unlimited workspaces with a fixed connection limit. However, **critical code review found race conditions, security issues, and testing gaps that must be addressed before production deployment.**

**Key Changes:**
- **Configuration:** Added 4 new environment variables (`DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_DB`, etc.)
- **New Files:**
  - `pkg/database/connection_manager.go` - Singleton connection manager (599 lines)
  - `pkg/database/connection_manager_test.go` - Unit tests (7 tests)
  - `internal/http/connection_stats_handler.go` - Monitoring endpoint
- **Updated Files:**
  - `config/config.go` - Added connection pool configuration
  - `internal/repository/workspace_postgres.go` - Uses ConnectionManager
  - `internal/app/app.go` - Initializes ConnectionManager
  - All repository tests - Updated with mock ConnectionManager

**Results:**
- From 4 workspaces max → UNLIMITED workspaces
- 10-100x performance improvement vs per-query connections
- All tests passing (22 packages, 0 failures)

**The document includes:**
- Problem analysis and solution architecture
- Complete implementation details (all 8 phases)
- Configuration and usage guides
- Testing strategy and results
- Deployment guide and monitoring
- Troubleshooting and advanced topics

## Other Features

- [Transactional API From Name Override](transactional-api-from-name-override.md)
- [Web Publication Feature](web-publication-feature.md)

## Plan Guidelines

When creating new plans:
1. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames (e.g., `feature-name-implementation.md`)
2. Include implementation status and date at the top
3. Document all code changes with file paths
4. Include testing results
5. Update this README when adding new plans
