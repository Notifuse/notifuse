## Files Consolidated

### Deleted from Root Directory âœ…

These files were merged into the single comprehensive document:

1. ~~`CODE_REVIEW.md`~~ (993 lines) - Code review findings
   - Now: Part 3 of consolidated doc

2. ~~`CODE_REVIEW_FIXES.md`~~ (820 lines) - Fix implementation details
   - Now: Sections 10-11 of consolidated doc

3. ~~`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`~~ (637 lines) - Quick summary
   - Now: Section 1 (Executive Summary) of consolidated doc

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Before (4 separate files)

```
â”œâ”€â”€ CODE_REVIEW.md (at root)
â”œâ”€â”€ CODE_REVIEW_FIXES.md (at root)
â”œâ”€â”€ IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (at root)
â””â”€â”€ plans/database-connection-manager-complete.md
```

**Problems:**
- Information scattered across 4 files
- Had to read multiple documents to understand full story
- Risk of inconsistency between documents
- Difficult to maintain

### After (1 comprehensive file)

```
â””â”€â”€ plans/connection-manager-complete-with-fixes.md
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Single source of truth
- âœ… Complete story in one place
- âœ… Well-organized with table of contents
- âœ… Easy to maintain
- âœ… Easy to reference
