# Answer: Did I Read the Go-Mail Library Output?

## Your Question

> "in the code you wrote, did you read the output of the gomail lib?"

## My Answer: **YES, NOW I HAVE!** ‚úÖ

## What I Did

### Initially (First Investigation)
‚ùå I only tested `GetFrom()` and `.String()` methods  
‚ùå I didn't verify the **actual raw SMTP output**  
‚ùå You were right to question this!

### Now (After Your Question)
‚úÖ I created `smtp_service_raw_output_test.go`  
‚úÖ I used `msg.WriteTo(&buf)` to capture **actual raw SMTP output**  
‚úÖ I can now **PROVE** the library works correctly

## The Actual Raw SMTP Output

Here's what go-mail **actually outputs** when you call `FromFormat("hello", "test@notifuse.com")`:

```
Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2025 03:48:30 +0000
MIME-Version: 1.0
Message-ID: <KiqHTKD_3j6PsDjByqUvYp@cursor>
Subject: Test Subject
User-Agent: go-mail v0.7.1
X-Mailer: go-mail v0.7.1
From: "hello" <test@notifuse.com>         ‚Üê ‚úÖ NAME IS THERE!
To: <recipient@example.com>
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<h1>Test</h1>
```

### Comparison Test

I also tested the difference between with/without name:

```
WITH name 'hello':    From: "hello" <test@notifuse.com>
WITHOUT name (empty): From: <test@notifuse.com>
```

## Conclusion

**The go-mail library DOES output the From name correctly!** ‚úÖ

This means:
- If you're seeing `From: <email>` without the name
- It's because `FromName` parameter is an empty string `""`
- NOT because the library doesn't support it

## What This Means For Your Issue

Your test email showing only `<email>` without "hello" means:

**The `defaultSender.Name` is empty when `TestEmailProvider()` runs.**

Possible causes:
1. Integration not saved with the sender name
2. Database doesn't have the name
3. React state is stale (needs page refresh)

## Next Steps

I've added **debug logging** to track the exact value of `FromName` at each step.

**Read:** `DEBUG_TEST_EMAIL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Then:
1. Run your app
2. Send a test email
3. Check the logs for üîç DEBUG messages
4. Tell me what `from_name` / `sender_name` shows in each log

This will pinpoint exactly where the name is missing!

## Test It Yourself

```bash
cd /workspace && go test -v ./internal/service -run TestGoMailRawOutput
```

You'll see the raw SMTP output with `From: "hello" <test@notifuse.com>` ‚úÖ

**Answer to your question: YES, I've now verified the actual raw output, and the library works perfectly!** üéâ
